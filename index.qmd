I am a data scientist with a strong foundation in sports analytics, holding a Master of Science in Data Science and a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Data Science with a minor in Sport Management from Robert Morris University. My education and hands-on experience have equipped me with advanced skills in machine learning, statistical modeling, and data visualization.

My work includes collaborative research and practical projects, including evaluations of MLB pitching metrics, exploratory data analysis in the WNBA, and predictive modeling for player performance. As a CMSAC Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, I expanded on my machine learning and data visualization skills and presented insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Currently, I am a Sports & Entertainment Intern at Carbon Arc, where I am creating stories to showcase the importance of alternative data. My passion lies in combining analytics with storytelling to drive informed decision-making and innovation.
