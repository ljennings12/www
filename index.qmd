I am a Robert Morris University student majoring in Statistics and Data Science with a minor in Sport Management and also pursuing a Master's in Data Science. I decided to combine my favorite subject (statistics) and hobby (sports) into a passion. 

I have always been interested in statistics, whether I was scanning the back of football cards, combing through Statcast leaders, or using advanced analytics to win in fantasy football. 

Iâ€™m eager to continue learning and gaining knowledge and experience in the data science and sports industries.
