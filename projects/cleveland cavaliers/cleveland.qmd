The challenge was to create tiers for the Cavaliers home games for the 2023/24 season and showcase the insights in ten days. We added to the provided data and weighted the variables to bring meaning to their significance. Then, we utilized a k-means clustering algorithm to group the games and arrange them into four tiers. Using the cluster centers, we interpreted the results and provided insight into each level. Also, we constructed a presentation of our findings to showcase the tiers and discuss our code in a manner that would be easily understandable for all audiences.
