As the MLB continues to evolve, there are new advantages every day. Stuff+ is a pitching metric that describes the "filth" of a pitch based on the ball-flight characteristics (e.g., velocity, movement, spin, and extension). A Stuff+ value of 100 means a pitch is considered league average; anything above or below 100 is considered above or below average respectively.

With the emergence of Stuff+ as a common metric used in pitcher evaluation, we wanted to evaluate how accurately the model predicted a pitcherâ€™s success (e.g., whiff rate and xwOBA) and how appropriately it weighed the factors that go into it.

Our goal is to provide insights to improve the Stuff+ model so it becomes a more reliable metric for player evaluation.
