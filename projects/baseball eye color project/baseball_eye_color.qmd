The project’s goal was to determine whether there is a relationship between an MLB player’s eye color and their performance in day games versus night games. We web-scraped over 300 variables from Fangraphs’ batter logs and game information (including day or night). We utilized two random forest models to predict a player’s eye color. The first was used to predict eye color in day games, and the second was used to predict eye color in night games. We expected a dropoff in test accuracy for night games because we expect less of a distinction between brown-eyed and blue-eyed players during these games; however, the actual dropoff in accuracy that we found was not statistically significant.

**Limitations/Future Work:** Will rework in the future by better selecting variables and having expected weighted on-base average (xwOBA) be the target of random forest models.
