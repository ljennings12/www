    "text": "The data was from the wehoop package, where each row corresponds to a shot attempt in the WNBA 2023 season. The hypotheses we examined are: 1) shooting efficiency and frequency between the best and worst teams, 2) who the best and worst performers are during the playoffs and 3) how do home teams’ performance differ from away teams’ performance during “clutch” time? Using fundamental EDA and data visualization techniques, we evaluated our hypotheses and presented our conclusions."

    "text": "The task was to analyze pitchers that may benefit from a role change using Baseball Savant pitch-by-pitch and Fangraphs season data. We used the Baseball Savant data to calculate the weighted on-base average (wOBA) for every pitcher because it isolates pitcher performance more effectively than batting average allowed or WHIP. Then, we utilized stepwise regression to determine the most significant variables to predict FIP. After finding the most important predictors, we created a decision tree model with k-fold cross-validation and looked at pitchers with incorrectly predicted roles in 2023. The model and subjective reasoning determined that SP Blake Snell, SP Steven Matz, and RP Víctor Gonzalez could transition well to the other classified role.\nLimitations/Future Work: Will rework in the future by using random forests instead of a single decision tree to decrease randomness and variance. Knowledge was limited at the time."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The project’s goal was to determine whether there is a relationship between an MLB player’s eye color and their performance in day games versus night games. We web-scraped over 300 variables from Fangraphs’ batter logs and game information (including day or night). We utilized two random forest models to predict a player’s eye color. The first was used to predict eye color in day games, and the second was used to predict eye color in night games. We expected a dropoff in test accuracy for night games because we expect less of a distinction between brown-eyed and blue-eyed players during these games; however, the actual dropoff in accuracy that we found was not statistically significant.\nLimitations/Future Work: Will rework in the future by better selecting variables and having expected weighted on-base average (xwOBA) be the target of random forest models."

    "text": "As the MLB continues to evolve, there are new advantages every day. Stuff+ is a pitching metric that describes the “filth” of a pitch based on the ball-flight characteristics (e.g., velocity, movement, spin, and extension). A Stuff+ value of 100 means a pitch is considered league average; anything above or below 100 is considered above or below average respectively.\nWith the emergence of Stuff+ as a common metric used in pitcher evaluation, we wanted to evaluate how accurately the model predicted a pitcher’s success (e.g., whiff rate and xwOBA) and how appropriately it weighed the factors that go into it.\nOur goal is to provide insights to improve the Stuff+ model so it becomes a more reliable metric for player evaluation.\nOur initial analysis is concentrated on the four-seam fastball, with plans to extend this research to other pitch types in future work."

We added to the provided data and weighted the variables to bring meaning to their significance. Then, we utilized a k-means clustering algorithm to group the games and arrange them into four tiers. Using the cluster centers, we interpreted the results and provided insight into each level. Also, we constructed a presentation of our findings to showcase the tiers and discuss our code in a manner that would be easily understandable for all audiences."
