    "title": "Making the Most of Your Day: Insights into Disney World Attraction Lines",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This project examined the factors influencing attraction wait times at Walt Disney World and how ride popularity has shifted from 2015 to 2019. Using data from TouringPlans.com, I analyzed average wait times for 14 major attractions, including favorites like Avatar Flight of Passage, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, and Slinky Dog Dash. Through exploratory data analysis and clustering, I compared attractions based on efficiency (ride time versus wait time), seasonal trends, weather patterns, and external factors such as school schedules. Insights showed that peak seasons, Christmas and major holiday weekends, consistently lead to the longest lines, while attractions like Spaceship Earth remain more accessible throughout the year.\nKey findings indicate that popular rides like Avatar Flight of Passage and Seven Dwarfs Mine Train often have inflated posted wait times, likely as a strategy to better manage crowds. Seasonal effects are more significant than day-of-week patterns, with “September Low” offering the best chance for shorter waits. Clustering highlighted efficiency differences, revealing that headline thrill rides often result in short experiences despite long waits, while slower attractions provide more balanced experiences."

    "text": "The data was from the wehoop package, where each row corresponds to a shot attempt in the WNBA 2023 season. The hypotheses we examined are: 1) shooting efficiency and frequency between the best and worst teams, 2) who the best and worst performers are during the playoffs and 3) how do home teams’ performance differ from away teams’ performance during “clutch” time? Using fundamental EDA and data visualization techniques, we evaluated our hypotheses and presented our conclusions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As the MLB continues to evolve, there are new advantages every day. Stuff+ is a pitching metric that describes the “filth” of a pitch based on the ball-flight characteristics (e.g., velocity, movement, spin, and extension). A Stuff+ value of 100 means a pitch is considered league average; anything above or below 100 is considered above or below average respectively.\nWith the emergence of Stuff+ as a common metric used in pitcher evaluation, we wanted to evaluate how accurately the model predicted a pitcher’s success (e.g., whiff rate and xwOBA) and how appropriately it weighed the factors that go into it.\nOur goal is to provide insights to improve the Stuff+ model so it becomes a more reliable metric for player evaluation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The task was to analyze pitchers that may benefit from a role change using Baseball Savant pitch-by-pitch and Fangraphs season data. We used the Baseball Savant data to calculate the weighted on-base average (wOBA) for every pitcher because it isolates pitcher performance more effectively than batting average allowed or WHIP. Then, we utilized stepwise regression to determine the most significant variables to predict FIP. After finding the most important predictors, we created a decision tree model with k-fold cross-validation and looked at pitchers with incorrectly predicted roles in 2023. The model and subjective reasoning determined that SP Blake Snell, SP Steven Matz, and RP Víctor Gonzalez could transition well to the other classified role.\nLimitations/Future Work: Will rework in the future by using random forests instead of a single decision tree to decrease randomness and variance. Knowledge was limited at the time."

We added to the provided data and weighted the variables to bring meaning to their significance. Then, we utilized a k-means clustering algorithm to group the games and arrange them into four tiers. Using the cluster centers, we interpreted the results and provided insight into each level. Also, we constructed a presentation of our findings to showcase the tiers and discuss our code in a manner that would be easily understandable for all audiences."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This project tackled the challenge of identifying the factors that influence NFL game over/under results, which are betting lines predicting the total points scored in a matchup. Since achieving profitability requires at least 52.4% prediction accuracy, my goal was to develop models that could surpass that threshold. Using play-by-play data from the nflreadr library (covering the 2021–2024 seasons), I compiled team-level statistics such as points per game, possessions, EPA (expected points added), giveaways, and pass rate over expected, along with contextual variables like weather, stadium type, and travel time zones. Each game was approached as a binary classification task (over or under), with engineered features designed to reflect matchup strength between offenses and defenses.\nI tested various machine learning methods, including logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, GAMs, SVMs, and a voting classifier, all trained with cross-validation. Logistic regression emerged as the top performer with approximately 55% test accuracy, followed by XGBoost at about 53.5%, both exceeding the profitability threshold. Key insights indicated that ball control, turnover margin, and opponent matchups were among the most predictive factors, while recent performance trends often revealed shifts not apparent in season-long averages. Despite its effectiveness, limitations remain: differences in coaching philosophy, team-specific schemes, and injuries are difficult to quantify, suggesting that hierarchical modeling could enhance future iterations."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This project examined whether a player’s eye color affects performance differences between day and night baseball games. Since eye color is determined by melanin in the iris, with lighter eyes generally more sensitive to light, the idea was that players with lighter eyes might encounter more challenges in bright daytime conditions. Using only outdoor games with clearly defined day (before 2:15 PM) and night (after 6:00 PM) start times, I expanded on Gerald Schifman’s 2015 study by applying linear regression, random forest models, and hierarchical modeling to test for effects on batting performance, measured via weighted on-base average (wOBA).\nThe results indicated only weak evidence that eye color has an effect, and it ranked much lower than other variables in predictive importance. Factors like weather, sunlight, shadows, and modern vision technology probably diminish any measurable influence. This work demonstrates how data science can investigate unconventional questions in sports analytics, while emphasizing the importance of considering context and limitations when analyzing results."
